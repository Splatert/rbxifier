# What is RBXifier?
RBXifier is a tool that lets you quickly replace roblox's textures with ones that you've created.


# How does it work?
This tool gets the zip archive that contains textures you've modified and distributes them to the latest roblox version folder via DotNetZip.

# Will this help me install my textures quicker?
Yep. Instead of taking the time to go look for the folder containing roblox's textures and replace files with the ones you have, the program does it for you. There's also a feature to revert the changes you've made to the folders containing textures.

# How do I make my own textures?
1. get a copy of the folders containing original roblox textures (Content and PlatformContent) and edit them with an image editor of your choice. Make sure that you don't leave the images outside their folders.

The folders containing roblox's textures can be found at C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/local/Roblox/Versions/ folder that contains RobloxPlayerBeta.exe

2. Create a zip archive of the two folders. Make sure that they're not in one folder. Keep them separate inside the zip archive.
3. Open RBXifier, choose the archive you've made, and click on RBXify.

If done correctly, the original textures will be replaced with your own textures.
